 Approximately 95% of the ocean remains unexplored, revealing that deep-sea exploration comes with considerable challenges, and at the same time, it presents amazing opportunities. Oceanic research imposes serious 
 risks on robotic navigation systems due to high pressure, low temperature, lack of sunlight, limited energy resources, and absence of GPS signals (Zhang B, et al., 2023). This research article focuses on the 
 cutting-edge navigation technology that enables autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to map and manoeuvre effectively in dynamic, unstructured environments. Furthermore, it addresses the supply of power that extends 
 mission duration, such as fuel cell solutions and innovative batteries allowing robots to operate independently for a longer period. This research aims to focus on the pros/cons of core technologies, advancing the 
 capabilities of self-navigating robots for long-term exploration and resource assessment in remote, challenging deep-sea areas.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<pre id="Introduction_InText" class="ex1">
  Designing self-navigating robots for deep-sea exploration comes with many challenges that engineers need to overcome. Engineers need to build autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that can function in the most extreme 
  and isolated conditions on Earth. Their primary goal is to create robots that can accomplish tasks independently, without human intervention (Wynn et al., 2014). Overcoming these challenges will be vital in refining 
  AUVs and realizing their complete functionality in underwater studies and exploration. AUVs require advanced technology, which can resist very high pressures and function in total darkness. These robots are critical for
  oceanographic research, resource monitoring, and environmental protection in the poorly explored and largely unexplored depths of the ocean (Wynn et al., 2014).
  </pre>

<h3 id="Mainbody">Main body</h3>
  <pre id="Mainbody_InText" class="ex1">
    The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth and pose extreme challenges for navigation tasks in deep-sea settings, due to the absence of GPS signals at depths beyond shallow waters (Zhang B, et al., 2023). This 
    limitation has been surpassed by the engineers through the addition of advanced technology into the self-navigating AUV, such as acoustic, inertial, and visual navigation systems. Acoustic positioning is the process 
    of sound waves that are transmitted and received between devices. Systems such as ultrasound baseline allow AUVs to determine their location at known points or surface stations (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Acoustic 
    navigation can be divided into three main types; Long Baseline systems (LBL), Short Baseline systems and Ultra Short Baseline systems (Zhang B, et al., 2023). LBL is currently the most widely utilised acoustic 
    navigation system due to its precision and dependability (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Long Baseline systems operate at frequencies around 12kHz which provide accurate positioning within a few meters over several kilometres
    (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Higher frequency LBL systems, achieve sub-centimetre precision and faster update rates (up to 10 Hz) but are limited to shorter ranges of about 100 meters due to a reduction in sound strength 
    in water (Zhang B, et al., 2023). These advancements in acoustic navigation highlight their essential role in enabling AUVs to navigate and perform complex operations in underwater environments.
    
    Additionally, another important aspect of AUVs is the development of efficient and reliable charging systems to support long-duration missions in remote environments. Because of the limited capacity of onboard energy 
    storage, AUVs depend significantly on advanced charging solutions, such as battery swapping, docking stations and Solar charging (Hasan et al., 2024). These systems must factor in extreme conditions like high pressure,
    low temperatures, and strong currents, impacting charging efficiency and durability (Zhang B, et al., 2023). One of the most common methods for AUVs when surfaced is battery swapping but it requires high downtime and 
    requires supporting vessel and crew (Hasan et al., 2024).  The total surfacing, battery swapping and descending time constitute 20% of the operation time per AUV cycle (Hasan et al., 2024). Battery swapping is not 
    considered the most efficient method, as it introduces significant delays and hinders operational efficiency (Hasan et al., 2024). Solar charging offers AUVs the potential for sustained mission endurance by harvesting 
    sunlight and storing energy in onboard batteries (Hasan et al., 2024). However, this method requires the AUV to surface during daylight hours, which can interrupt submerged operations (Hasan et al., 2024). The SAUV I 
    (as shown in Figure 1), is one of the pioneering solar-powered AUVs, which was designed as a lightweight system (90 kg) equipped with two 30-W solar panels (Hasan et al., 2024). Its successor, the SAUV II, was 
    developed (Hasan et al., 2024).  This second-generation model features a larger solar array (1 m² of panels) and a more robust energy system with a 32 V, 2 kWh capacity (Hasan et al., 2024).  Solar power generated by 
    underwater vehicles can be calculated by the following equation,                                                                        
                                        P<sub>solar</sub> = η<sub>solar</sub>. A<sub>solar</sub>.I<sub>solar</sub> </p>
    where P<sub>solar</sub> represents solar power, η<sub>solar</sub> denotes the efficiency of the solar panels, A<sub>solar</sub> signifies the surface 
    area of the solar panels, and I<sub>solar</sub> represents the solar irradiance, which is the solar energy received per unit area (Hasan et al., 2024). 
    This equation helps in assessing the feasibility and optimisation of solar charging systems in AUVs, empowering scientists and engineers to develop more 
    efficient solutions (Hasan et al., 2024).</p>

    A primary challenge for engineers is designing AUVs capable of withstanding high-pressure and extreme temperatures. Achieving this requires using advanced materials and innovative engineering solutions specifically 
    tailored to the harsh conditions of deep-sea environments. AUV hull is critical in shielding delicate components like electronics and batteries from extreme pressure while minimising drag and compressibility 
    (Elkolali & Alcocer, 2022). As AUVs descend, increasing external pressure causes the hull to compress, leading to buoyancy loss (Elkolali & Alcocer, 2022). Choosing the right material for the hulls of AUVs is 
    essential to help them survive the intense pressure and extreme temperatures of the deep sea. Carbon/Epoxy and Glass/Epoxy composites are the go-to materials for building AUVs because they offer great performance at 
    a reasonable cost. Carbon/Epoxy is particularly popular because it’s 20-30% lighter than glass fibres, yet it’s stronger and stiffer, making it a perfect fit for the tough conditions underwater (Elkolali & Alcocer, 
    2022). AUV designs have taken ideas from various bionic models, including biological fish, to enhance their capabilities. For example, AUVs inspired by manta rays utilise wing-like structures and control systems for 
    enhanced manoeuvrability, enabling efficient underwater exploration with minimal environmental disruption (Hasan et al., 2024). The smooth movement of these AUVs reduces their impact on fragile ecosystems, allowing 
    them to collect data and explore with minimal disruption (Hasan et al., 2024). These advancements demonstrate engineer's success in creating more efficient, durable, and sustainable underwater technologies.

     In the end, AUVs have significantly improved over the years, with advanced technology and materials, they are able to operate in the most adverse conditions of the ocean. From advanced navigation systems to solar-
     powered charging solutions, engineers are overcoming various obstacles to enhance AUV efficiency, durability, and environmental sustainability. These breakthroughs not only pave the way for further ocean exploration
     but also ensure that AUVs play a key role in scientific research and the conservation of marine ecosystems.
