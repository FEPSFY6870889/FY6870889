        Approximately 95% of the ocean remains unexplored, revealing the significant challenges and incredible opportunities in deep-sea exploration. Oceanic research 
        imposes serious risks on robotic navigation systems due to high pressure, low temperature, lack of sunlight, limited energy resources, and absence of GPS 
        signals (Zhang B, et al., 2023). This research article focuses on the cutting-edge navigation technology that enables autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) 
        to map and manoeuvre effectively in dynamic, unstructured environments. Furthermore, it addresses the supply of power that extends mission duration, such as 
        fuel cell solutions and innovative batteries allowing robots to operate independently for a longer period. This research aims to focus on the pros/cons of 
        core technologies, advancing the capabilities of self-navigating robots for long-term exploration and resource assessment in remote, challenging deep-sea 
        areas.

        Designing self-navigating robots for deep-sea environments involves addressing the challenges of creating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that can 
        function independently in some of the Earthâ€™s most extreme and remote conditions. Numerous obstacles must be overcome before AUVs can be fully perfected. 
        The primary goal for engineers is to develop robotic systems capable of completing long-duration missions without human intervention (Wynn et al., 2014). 
        This requires advanced technology to endure immense pressures and operate in near-total darkness. AUVs are essential for oceanographic research, resource 
        monitoring, and environmental protection in the largely unexplored depths of the ocean (Wynn et al., 2014).

        The oceans, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, present significant challenges for navigation in deep-sea environments due to the absence of GPS signals 
        at depths beyond shallow waters (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Engineers have overcome this issue by installing high-end technology into self-navigating AUVs, 
        such as acoustic, inertial, and visual navigation systems. Acoustic positioning is the process of sound waves that are transmitted and received between 
        devices. Systems such as ultrasound baseline allow AUVs to determine their location at known points or surface stations (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Acoustic 
        navigation can be divided into three main types; Long Baseline systems (LBL), Short Baseline systems and Ultra Short Baseline systems (Zhang B, et al., 2023).
        LBL is currently the most widely utilised acoustic navigation system due to its precision and dependability (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Long Baseline systems 
        operate at frequencies around 12kHz which provide accurate positioning within a few meters over several kilometers (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Higher frequency 
        LBL systems, achieve sub-centimetre precision and faster update rates (up to 10 Hz) but are limited to shorter ranges of about 100 meters due to a reduction 
        in sound strength in water (Zhang B, et al., 2023). These advancements in acoustic navigation highlight their essential role in enabling AUVs to navigate and 
        perform complex operations in underwater environments.

        In conclusion, the development of AUVs has greatly advanced with the use of innovative technologies and materials, enabling these vehicles to perform in the 
        most challenging deep-sea environments. From advanced navigation systems to solar-powered charging solutions, engineers are overcoming numerous obstacles 
        to improve AUV efficiency, durability, and environmental sustainability. These advancements are vital for furthering ocean exploration and ensuring that 
        AUVs contribute to both scientific research and environmental conservation efforts.
