    Approximately 95% of the ocean remains unexplored, revealing the significant challenges and incredible opportunities in deep-sea exploration. Oceanic research 
    imposes serious risks on robotic navigation systems due to high pressure, low temperature, lack of sunlight, limited energy resources, and absence of GPS 
    signals (Zhang B, et al., 2023). This research article focuses on the cutting-edge navigation technology that enables autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) 
    to map and manoeuvre effectively in dynamic, unstructured environments. Furthermore, it addresses the supply of power that extends mission duration, such as 
    fuel cell solutions and innovative batteries allowing robots to operate independently for a longer period. This research aims to focus on the pros/cons of 
    core technologies, advancing the capabilities of self-navigating robots for long-term exploration and resource assessment in remote, challenging deep-sea 
    areas.

<p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    Designing self-navigating robots for deep-sea environments involves addressing the challenges of creating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that can 
    function independently in some of the Earth’s most extreme and remote conditions. Numerous obstacles must be overcome before AUVs can be fully perfected. 
    The primary goal for engineers is to develop robotic systems capable of completing long-duration missions without human intervention (Wynn et al., 2014). 
    This requires advanced technology to endure immense pressures and operate in near-total darkness. AUVs are essential for oceanographic research, resource 
    monitoring, and environmental protection in the largely unexplored depths of the ocean (Wynn et al., 2014).

    The oceans, covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, present significant challenges for navigation in deep-sea environments due to the absence of GPS signals 
    at depths beyond shallow waters (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Engineers have overcome this issue by installing high-end technology into self-navigating AUVs, 
    such as acoustic, inertial, and visual navigation systems. Acoustic positioning is the process of sound waves that are transmitted and received between 
    devices. Systems such as ultrasound baseline allow AUVs to determine their location at known points or surface stations (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Acoustic 
    navigation can be divided into three main types; Long Baseline systems (LBL), Short Baseline systems and Ultra Short Baseline systems (Zhang B, et al., 2023).
    LBL is currently the most widely utilised acoustic navigation system due to its precision and dependability (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Long Baseline systems 
    operate at frequencies around 12kHz which provide accurate positioning within a few meters over several kilometers (Zhang B, et al., 2023). Higher frequency 
    LBL systems, achieve sub-centimetre precision and faster update rates (up to 10 Hz) but are limited to shorter ranges of about 100 meters due to a reduction 
    in sound strength in water (Zhang B, et al., 2023). These advancements in acoustic navigation highlight their essential role in enabling AUVs to navigate and 
    perform complex operations in underwater environments.

    Additionally, another important aspect of AUVs is the development of efficient and reliable charging systems to support long-duration missions in remote 
    environments. Because of the limited capacity of onboard energy storage, AUVs depend significantly on advanced charging solutions, such as battery swapping, 
    docking stations and Solar charging (Hasan et al., 2024). These systems must factor in extreme conditions like high pressure, low temperatures, and strong 
    currents, impacting charging efficiency and durability (Zhang B, et al., 2023). One of the most common methods for AUVs when surfaced is battery swapping but 
    it requires high downtime and requires supporting vessel and crew (Hasan et al., 2024).  The total surfacing, battery swapping and descending time constitute 
    20% of the operation time per AUV cycle (Hasan et al., 2024). Battery swapping is not considered the most efficient method, as it introduces significant 
    delays and hinders operational efficiency (Hasan et al., 2024). Solar charging offers AUVs the potential for sustained mission endurance by harvesting 
    sunlight and storing energy in onboard batteries (Hasan et al., 2024). However, this method requires the AUV to surface during daylight hours, which can
    interrupt submerged operations (Hasan et al., 2024). The SAUV I (as shown in Figure 1), is one of the pioneering solar-powered AUVs, which was designed as 
    a lightweight system (90 kg) equipped with two 30-W solar panels (Hasan et al., 2024). Its successor, the SAUV II, was developed (Hasan et al., 2024).  
    This second-generation model features a larger solar array (1 m² of panels) and a more robust energy system with a 32 V, 2 kWh capacity (Hasan et al., 2024). 
    Solar power generated by underwater vehicles can be calculated by the following equation,

    where, Psolar represents solar power, ηsolar denotes the efficiency of the solar panels, Asolar signifies the surface area of the solar panels, and Isolar 
    represents the solar irradiance, which is the solar energy received per unit area (Hasan et al., 2024). This equation helps in assessing the feasibility and 
    optimisation of solar charging systems in AUVs, empowering scientists and engineers to develop more efficient solutions (Hasan et al., 2024).
